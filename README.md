In Week 5, I brought my JavaScript skills to life by building a fully functional calculator app. This project was a hands-on way to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical thinking. I created interactive buttons, handled user input, and implemented the core math operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was exciting to see how a few lines of JavaScript could turn a static layout into a working mini app!
